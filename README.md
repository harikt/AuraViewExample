# Example of integrating Aura.View and Aura.Html

Version 1 of Aura.View is split into two 

1. [Aura.View](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.View)
2. [Aura.Html](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Html)

It is flexible enough to integrate on any frameworks 
like [Aura.Input form inside slim](http://harikt.com/blog/2014/09/02/aura-input-form-inside-slim-framework/), 
[Extending Plates With Aura Html Helpers](http://harikt.com/blog/2014/05/13/extending-plates-with-aura-html-helpers/).

So this is to demonstrate how to integrate both.

Consider reading its own documention for additional information.
